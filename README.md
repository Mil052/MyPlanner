# MyPlanner
Version Alpha - will be developed over the next weeks !!!   
(as next step I'm going to add authentication and user creation)   
As for now you can't add your account.   
Fetch and display data, add new task/note and delete works.
## App description
This is my firs project made with Angular at front-end and Google Firebase on back-end.   
The app is a 'Planner' / 'To Do List App'.   
The application allows user to write tasks for each day and notes (regardless of the date).
## How to run the code:
* Download the code and instal dependencies (in the project directory run: `npm install`)
* Run the app in the development mode (In the project directory run: `ng serve`, then open http://localhost:4200/ in the browser)
